 * How many candidates to ask for. Filtering removes products, so asking for
 * exactly four and then discarding two leaves a block half empty. The service
 * over-fetches by a configurable multiple and trims afterwards.
 *
 * When to give up on an engine and try the next. An engine with no data returns
 * an empty list, which is a normal answer, not an error. The chain runs from the
 * most specific engine to the most general and stops as soon as it has enough.
 *
 * Whether a partial answer is worth showing. One lonely product under a heading
 * that promises recommendations looks worse than no block at all, so a result
 * below `min_results` is discarded entirely.
